    <h1 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1 — Fade</h1>
 The back-alley stench of rotten trash and spent nexeon crystals. Moonlight barely 
touched the damp bricks, leaving the shadows thick and restless. My claws flexed 
instinctively, scraping softly against the steel pipe in my hand. The noise of distant 
machinery filled the air—dull and steady, masking anything nearby.
 Itʼs close. Can you feel it? The thought wasnʼt mine. It threaded through my mind, 
coiled and certain. I can smell it. Canʼt you?
 I ignored the words—or tried to—but my ears twitched, straining for the faint 
scrape Iʼd already heard once. A claw against stone.
 There—a glint of green. The glow came next, faint but unmistakable, slicing 
through the shadows like a blade. The creature followed soon after, its narrow 
head tilting unnaturally as its glowing eyes locked onto me.
 “Wraithhound,ˮ I said, the word heavy on my tongue. My grip tightened on the 
pipe, its metal biting into my palm.
 The creature moved closer, its claws clicking softly against the stone. Smoke 
curled from its body, faded wisps of blue that twisted unnaturally as it stopped 
just short of the moonlight. It waited with an unrelenting gaze.
 Look at you, pretending youʼre ready for this. The thought pushed itself forward, 
laced with amusement. Should I count the seconds 'til you screw this up?
 The wraithhound lunged, its claws tearing through the wall as it propelled itself 
toward me. I ducked low, the rush of air brushing past my fur as the pipe cracked 
against its ribs. The sound reverberated through my arms—a satisfying crack—
 before the creature hit the ground.
 It yelped, the sound guttural and wrong, as its smoky body coiled into a mangled 
nightmare. For a moment, it stayed down, its green eyes dimming. Then the smoke 
gathered again, reforming as the hound rose.
 “Great,ˮ I muttered, my claws itching to be free.
Youʼre holding yourself back with that pipe. The thought hissed, cutting through 
my focus. Are you trying to make it a fair fight or do you enjoy screwing up?
 “Try saying something useful.ˮ I spoke quickly as the beast prepared its attack.
 Try behaving like a monster instead of pretending to be human. The voice 
responded without missing a beat.
 The wraithhoundʼs next attack was faster, its limbs elongating grotesquely as it 
leapt again. I spun, swinging the pipe in a tight arc. The metal met empty air. Too 
fast.
 Its claws tore into my shoulder, the impact driving me to my knees. Pain bloomed, 
sharp and immediate, as I twisted away, baring my teeth. The hound landed a few 
feet away, its body rippling unnaturally as if mocking the laws of physics.
 The pipe fell from my hand. Enough of this.
 My claws extended with a sharp click, the sound breaking through the alley like a 
challenge. The wraithhound snarled, smoke billowing from its maw as it lunged 
again. This time, I met it head-on.
 I ducked low, driving my claws into its chest in a single, fluid motion. The smoke 
around it burned cold, biting at my skin as I ripped upward. The creature let out a 
shriek, its body convulsing as its form splintered .
 “Not so tough now, are you?ˮ My breath came in quick bursts as I watched it 
dissolve into smoke and mist.
 The acrid smoke clung to me as I stepped back. My claws retracted slowly as my 
hand brushed the discarded pipe and a faint scent of ash curled around me like a 
warning.
 Itʼs never just one, the thought surfaced, quieter this time but no less intrusive. 
You should know that by now.
 A second growl reverberated through the alley, low and menacing. Then another.
 I froze, the back of my neck prickling as two more green glows cut through the 
darkness ahead. The shapes emerged slowly, their bodies forming like smoke 
caught in a windstorm. More wraithhounds.
 “Oh, come on!ˮ
 Didnʼt I just say—
“Donʼt start.ˮ
 The hounds didnʼt hesitate this time. They lunged in unison, tearing into the stone 
with each stride. I leapt sideways, vaulting off a wall to avoid them. Their 
momentum carried them into the narrow corridor, claws scraping in frustration as 
they spun towards me.
 Two now? Good game.
 Cadmeaʼs commentary made my blood burn hot, but I didnʼt have time to respond. 
I dashed toward the nearest hound as it swiped at me, its sharp claws glinting like 
razors. I grabbed a discarded crate and slammed it into the beastʼs face. The 
wood splintered on impact, and the hound staggered back, snarling.
 The second hound darted in from the side. It grazed my arm as I twisted, blood 
staining the sleeve of my jacket. I kept moving, pushing down the pain. I kicked off 
the wall to gain height, and my claws extended with a familiar click as I raked them 
across the beastʼs back. Blue smoke hissed and curled where the strike landed, 
and the hound shrieked. But it didnʼt stop.
 Theyʼre getting smarter, Cadmea noted. Why donʼt you have that feature?
 “Shut up.ˮ
 The first hound lunged again, its body distorting unnaturally as it stretched in mid
air. I rolled forward, narrowly avoiding its strike, and grabbed a loose length of 
chain from the ground. Whipping around, I lashed the chain at its legs, tangling 
them long enough to slam the broken pipe into its side. The impact creaked 
through the alley, and the hound dissolved into a fine blue mist.
 “Thatʼs one.ˮ
 Counting now? Youʼre adorable. Use your fingers if you need to, I wonʼt judge.
 The remaining hound snarled, circling me. Its eyes glowed brighter, and smoke 
billowed thicker from its form. A shift in the air sent a shiver down my spine—
 something was wrong.
 The hound didnʼt attack alone this time. Another shape materialized behind it, the 
green glow of its eyes piercing the dark.
 “Three, seriously?ˮ
 Try four, Cadmea said.
I spun as another growl erupted from the opposite direction. A fourth hound 
appeared, cutting off my escape route.
 “Perfect. Just perfect.ˮ
 Relax. Phase if you need to. Cadmea sighed, exasperated. Even pushing aside his 
sarcastic remarks.
 “And risk bringing more back with me? No way.ˮ
 It wouldnʼt make a difference.
 “…Good point.ˮ
 The hounds lunged together, their coordination unnerving. I darted into the street, 
narrowly avoiding the claws aimed at my legs. They followed, their glowing eyes 
locked on me as if nothing else in the world existed.
 The crowded square came into view, its lights bright and artificial. The city didnʼt 
sleep, but it had its quiet moments. This wasnʼt one of them. Even in the 
backstreets, the faint murmur of life in Riar carried over—voices from the taverns 
on the main roads, the soft clatter of boots against stone, the occasional burst of 
laughter breaking through the haze. All of it blurred together, distant and 
unimportant. Civilians milled about, oblivious to the danger barreling toward them.
 “Great timing, Fox,ˮ I muttered.
 I bolted into the crowd, weaving through clusters of people. The hounds pursued, 
their smoke-filled forms twisting and bounding over carts and stalls. People 
screamed as the creatures leapt past them, but the hounds never deviated from 
their path. They didnʼt attack anyone else. Just me.
 Youʼve got their undivided attention, Cadmea said. You should feel flattered.
 “Flattered or hunted?ˮ
 Now youʼre getting it.
 My tail flicked in irritation, but I couldnʼt shake the truth in the words. 
Wraithhounds didnʼt wander into Riar on their own. They couldnʼt. They werenʼt 
from this realm. Someone had sent them from the Aether Silva—Cadmeaʼs realm. 
Sent them to hunt me.
 I ducked into a narrow alley, the tight space forcing the hounds to follow single 
file. The first one lunged, its claws grazing the wall as it reached for me. I leapt 
upward, grabbing a rusted fire escape and swinging myself over its head. The 
hound slammed into the wall, disoriented for a moment, but the others surged 
forward, snapping at my heels.
 Spotting a pile of crates stacked precariously against a wall, I kicked the bottom 
one as I ran past. The containers toppled, crashing down onto the second hound. 
Its shriek cut through the night as the contents pierced its smoky form, dissolving 
it into a faint mist.
 “Two,ˮ I muttered, sprinting forward.
 The remaining hounds were relentless, scraping closer with each stride. My lungs 
burned, and the wounds on my arm and shoulder throbbed, but I couldnʼt stop 
moving.
 The Hydraʼs Den came into view, its nexeon-lit sign flickering faintly. I veered 
toward it, leaping over a toppled fruit stand as the hounds closed in. One slashed 
through my jacket as I hit the ground and rolled.
 Smooth. Cadmea couldnʼt mask his sneer—not that he tried. Now we get to listen 
to Caelum lecture us on maintaining pristine clothing.
 “Iʼm more than happy to leave you here.ˮ I said as I scrambled to my feet, throwing 
myself toward the Denʼs entrance. Dashing across the street, I leapt onto the hood 
of a parked car, vaulting off of it, putting some distance between me and my 
assailants… for a moment.
 You dare threaten me with my deepest desire?
 He chuckled in my head as I rolled my eyes.
 A group of drunks loitered near the entrance of the bar, their laughter spilling into 
the street like the stench of stale ale.
 One of them turned, his glazed eyes studying me for a moment. “What in Eikanʼs 
name are—?ˮ he asked, his speech slurring from inebriation. “Hey, Benny. Get a 
load of the freak in the fox costume!ˮ
 “Excuse me,ˮ I muttered, ignoring the snide laughter from his friends as I swiftly 
slipped past. The man shouted after me, but his words fell flat as I entered the bar. 
I heard their yells when they noticed my aggressors, and they scrambled to get 
inside from behind me.
The last of the bunch made it in the nick of time, slamming the heavy door shut 
behind him, cutting off the sounds of the beasts thudding and scraping to get 
inside.
 Inside, the barʼs chaotic noise was a welcome reprieve. Nobody seemed to notice 
the chaos outside. I leaned against a pillar, breathing heavily as my lungs cooled 
down from all the activity. Sweat dripped down my temple, and the faint scent of 
ash still clung to my clothes.
 “Youʼre late,ˮ the bartender said, barely glancing up from his work.
 “Had company,ˮ I muttered, pulling my hood lower as I made my way toward the 
back.
 The bartenderʼs gaze flicked toward the door, where thuds and scrapes still 
echoed from outside. His lips curled in a half-smirk as he set down the glass heʼd 
been wiping. “Company, huh? Youʼre lucky I donʼt charge extra for bringing 
trouble into the Den.ˮ
 I ignored the remark, weaving through the haze of smoke and mismatched tables. 
My tail flicked once before I tucked it close. The fewer stares, the better.
 Youʼre a vision of subtlety, Cadmea sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Iʼm 
sure no one noticed the sweaty fox slinking in like heʼs being chased by demons. 
Oh wait—
 “You are insufferable today. Did I piss you off somehow?ˮ I said under my breath, 
earning a curious glance from a patron nursing his drink. I glared back until he 
looked away. The last thing I needed was for people to think I was talking to 
myself.
 Reaching the counter, I drummed my claws softly on the worn surface. “Is it ready 
or not?ˮ
 The bartender cocked his head, raising an eyebrow. “Itʼs been ready. Whatʼs in 
here thatʼs so important, anyway?ˮ He crouched behind the counter, retrieving a 
small package wrapped in dark cloth, shaking it gently next to his ear before 
handing it over.
 “Just some gifts,ˮ I said with growing excitement.
 “Sure,ˮ he said, eyeing me quizzically. “Oh. And you can let your roommate know 
Iʼm no moron. This is the last time.ˮ
Leaning against the counter, he crossed his arms. His piercing blue eyes flicked 
toward the door where the wraithhounds were relentless. “You think I donʼt 
recognize when Iʼm being played? That little brother of yours—whatʼs his name? 
Caelum? Heʼs lucky Iʼm not charging double. You tell him this is the last time.ˮ
 I blinked, trying to mask the twitch in my ears. “Caelum? Heʼs not my—ˮ My 
sentence ended short as I shook my head, keeping myself focused. His relation to 
me wasnʼt the important part. “What does Caelum have to do with this?ˮ
 The bartender shook his as he wiped down the counter. His hair, classic short 
back and sides cut, had a hint of silver at the temple that wasnʼt noticeable until 
under a light. “Oh, please. Do I look like a nexeon miner fresh off the line? I know 
how this game works.ˮ As he straightened, his eyes locked onto mine. “He sends 
you because youʼre good at looking harmless. Guess he figured youʼd have better 
luck than he did.ˮ
 “Wait, but—ˮ My claws scratched lightly against the wood as I tried to find the 
words. “I think youʼve got this all wrong. I came here for me. Nobody sent me.ˮ
 His laugh was dry, cutting. “Sure. And the hounds outside? They were what, 
drawn to your winning personality? If you want to play dumb, then get out.ˮ
 Oh, but heʼs not playing, Cadmeaʼs voice interjected, honeyed with sarcasm. 
Thankfully, it was in my head. Heʼs just that naturally clueless.
 “Iʼm not lying,ˮ I said firmly, desperately seeking control of the conversation. My 
tail flicked anxiously against my legs, betraying the calm front I was trying to hold. 
“I just needed to grab this. It has nothing to do with Caelum.ˮ
 The bartender leaned closer, lowering his voice so only I could hear. “Let me give 
you a little advice, kid. If youʼre going to run errands for him, make sure youʼre 
getting paid in something better than sob stories. Heʼs not half as smart as he 
thinks he is.ˮ
 I forced a breath through my teeth, clinging to what remained of my composure. 
“Caelum doesnʼt owe you anything. And this isnʼt for him. I mean, it is, but he 
doesnʼt know about it.ˮ
 “Right.ˮ His smirk widened as he straightened. “And Iʼm a priest of Eikan. Next 
time, tell him to handle his own mess. This is a warning.ˮ
Are you just going to take that? Burn the place down! Cadmea said, a pang of 
mania seeping through his tone.
 Leaning forward, I growled through my teeth, extending my claws. “Iʼm really the 
last person you want to be threatening.ˮ I said, my voice low and menacing.
 The tavern grew quiet. Each patron suddenly focused on us, ready to jump at the 
first sign of movement. I looked around at all the faces, slinking back slightly.
 “Wrong.ˮ The bartenderʼs grin never faltered as he leaned over the counter, flexing 
his biceps with his arms crossed. His stance oozing in confidence. ˮThat would be 
me.ˮ
 Before I could retort, a chair scraped harshly against the floor. The sound silenced 
the room like a blade slicing through tension. A towering patron, built like he was 
part ox, pushed himself to his feet. He adjusted his jacket with exaggerated 
slowness, his stony gaze settling on me.
 “Everything good here, Radek?ˮ The manʼs voice was gravelly, like stone grinding 
against stone. He cracked his knuckles, the sound loud in the sudden stillness.
 The bartender—Radek, apparently—gave him a casual nod, his eyes remaining in 
place. “Just a misunderstanding, Dren. No need to get involved.ˮ
 Oh, let him get involved. Cadmeaʼs excitement swirled through my thoughts. 
Whatʼs life without a challenge? Listen. Weʼll knock over some tables and thereʼs a 
vat of acid—ˮ
 I talked over his asinine idea, straightening up. My eyes slowly drifted to meet the 
hulking manʼs glare for a split second before stepping back and retracting my 
claws. “Itʼs not for Caelum,ˮ I said, my tone as calm as I could manage, although I 
was fuming. Intimidation was ineffective, but backing down from the truth wasnʼt 
an option. “I was just trying to… clarify. No threats here.ˮ
 Radek snorted, clearly unimpressed, but he gestured for Dren to sit back down. 
The man hesitated, his gaze still locked on me, before finally sinking into his chair 
with a grunt.
 Cadmea pouted dramatically in my mind. Coward. I had three brilliant plans, and 
you ruined them all.
 “Next time, donʼt bring your drama into my bar,ˮ Radek said, his voice low but 
pointed. “I donʼt care who sent you. This is your one warning.ˮ
I bit my tongue, nodding once, tight-lipped, and turned toward the exit. My heart 
was still pounding, but at least I had the package.
 Just as I reached the door, I stopped. A thought hit me, sharp and inconvenient. I 
winced. “One more thing,ˮ I said, spinning back around.
 Radek raised an eyebrow, clearly annoyed. “What now?ˮ
 I swallowed crow—no chewing, no eating. Just swallowed it. “Can I grab, uh, 
something specific? Liquor.ˮ My ears twitched. “Itʼs called Basiliskʼs Teeth?ˮ
 Radek stared at me for a long moment before sighing heavily. “Basiliskʼs Breath.ˮ 
Any shred of credibility I had left instantly vanished. He stared at me 
incredulously. “Wait here,ˮ he said, disappearing into the back room.
 You are incredible, Andrew! Cadmea couldnʼt contain his laughter. His cackling 
consumed my thoughts. You can never show your face around here again! How 
humiliating.
 I grimaced, but didnʼt feed into it. Tapping my claws idly on the counter, my eyes 
scanned the room. Thatʼs when I noticed someone watching me.
 A figure lingered a few feet away, his tattered clothes too pristine for the grime
streaked bar. Loose threads dangled from his shirt, but the fabric was spotless, 
catching the dim light like it didnʼt belong here. He didnʼt belong here.
 As he stepped closer, a foreign scent trailed him—crisp and clean, out of place in 
a room soaked with sweat and stale ale. His calculated movements were as if he 
was used to eyes always following him.
 “Trouble with the bartender?ˮ His voice came out smoothly, but with a clipped 
tone, like he was holding back a more polished accent.
 “Nothing I canʼt handle,ˮ I said shortly, keeping my voice neutral.
 He tilted his head, a gleam from the edges of his hair betraying his disheveled 
visage. His vibrant blue eyes caught the light with a sparkle. “Youʼve got an 
interesting way of handling it.ˮ
 Something about the strangerʼs smile unsettled me, like he knew more about me 
than he let on. “Do I know you?ˮ
 He smiled faintly, his expression both amused and guarded. “Not yet.ˮ
Is… is he… cruising you? Cadmea could hardly contain his laughter. He was having 
the time of his life.
 Heat rushed to my ears. “What the hell does that even mean?ˮ The words escaped 
louder than I intended, drawing a quizzical look from the guy.
 Another cackle. This just keeps getting better. No shovel needed! His sarcasm 
dripped like venom, but I didnʼt understand what he was talking about. Ask him if 
heʼs lost, or better yet, if heʼs royalty slumming it with the commoners. Thatʼll go 
over well.
 “Sorry,ˮ I said, a tinge of guilt creeping up on me. “Reflexive response.ˮ My voice 
was low as I gestured to the room with my eyes.
 The stranger briefly paused as he studied my expression. Then he nodded, 
shifting slightly as he stepped closer. His gaze held an undeniable curiosity. 
“Youʼre not from around here,ˮ I said, the words slipping out before I could stop 
them.
 “Neither are you,ˮ he countered, his smile widening just enough to show a hint of 
teeth, perfectly straight and unstained. “But I imagine you blend in better than I 
do.ˮ
 I couldnʼt help but grin like Iʼd found the end of a rainbow as I pondered the 
absurdity of his statement. As far as I knew, I was the only hybrid in existence. An 
enigma of humanity. A fox and a human put together. And then… there was 
Cadmea... because being the only hybrid wasnʼt enough.
 My tail responded with a swish, absent-mindedly brushing against his arm. The 
brief contact was electric, nerve endings sparking like a shattered nexeon crystal. 
I jerked back before the rush could settle, my tail twitching as if it had a mind of its 
own.
 “A little skittish, are you—or perhaps itʼs something else? Something… 
unexpected?ˮ His sharp eyes held an intensity youʼd expect from someone 
accustomed to giving orders, not following them. They flicked down to where my 
tail had been before meeting mine again, his path precise—unwavering.
 Heʼs just as braindead as you are. Cadmea said, his excitement fading out to 
accommodate his typical superiority complex.
“You… realize what you just said… right?ˮ I asked, bewildered, my ears twitching 
and tail swishing to convey the irony. It was true, he stuck out. But he didnʼt have a 
tail, moveable ears, fur, or paws.
 His smile didnʼt falter, but a moment of realization flashed through his expression. 
“Right. Letʼs say weʼre neck and neck.ˮ
 I rolled my eyes, my sheepish smile fading, but before I could respond, Radek 
returned. He carried a dark glass bottle in hand. “Youʼve got a name?ˮ Radek 
asked, looking directly at the stranger, his tone casual but edged with suspicion.
 The blondeʼs smile didnʼt waver as he responded, confidence pouring out of him. 
Iʼd never seen anyone so sure of their own name. “Asher.ˮ
 Cadmea broke into a fit of laughter again in my head, without explanation. I almost 
asked, but thought better of it.
 “Right.ˮ The bartenderʼs expression hardened as he set the bottle down with a 
heavy thud. His eyes narrowed, flicking between us before settling on Asher.
 “Well, Asher, this isnʼt a place for loitering. Youʼve got five seconds to decide if 
youʼre staying or making yourself scarce.ˮ
 Asher tilted his head slightly, an almost regal gesture despite the roughness of his 
appearance. “Fret not. I was just leaving.ˮ
 Radekʼs eyes narrowed, but he said nothing as Asher turned back to me. “It was… 
interesting meeting you,ˮ the blonde said, clearly taking in the view. My face felt 
hot again. Being in the spectacle that way was… discomforting.
 Unsure what to make of him, I nodded. Asher lingered for a moment longer before 
approaching the door. The wraithhounds had given up their assault, although I 
couldnʼt recall when the noise stopped. With a final glance back, he pushed the 
heavy door open and slipped out.
 Radek shook his head as he handed me the bottle. “Watch yourself, kid. Some 
people donʼt belong here, no matter how good they are at pretending.ˮ
 “Thatʼs funny.ˮ I said, securing my hood as the bartender returned to his work, “Iʼm 
just pretending, but you never kicked me out.ˮ
 I clutched the package and the bottle, turning towards the back exit. He hardly 
looked up as he let out a low chuckle. “Youʼre not pretending, kid. You just havenʼt 
realized it.ˮ
Pushing the door open, the night air felt icy against my face. I contemplated his 
words for a moment before starting my trek home. As I stepped into the shadows, 
I couldnʼt shake the feeling that Iʼd be seeing Asher again soon.
 Heʼs right, you know. Cadmea broke through my reverie. Youʼre no better than any 
of them.
 I frowned, tucking the package deeper into my jacket and clutching onto the bottle 
of liquor. “Think what you want,ˮ I said, my voice sharp. “Iʼve got what I came for.ˮ
 Got what you came for, but still leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for the hounds, 
Cadmea muttered, his tone dripping with disdain. Brilliant. Really. You should 
teach classes with recklessness.
 The street behind me was too quiet for a city like Riar. The wraithhounds had 
fallen back for now, but that didnʼt mean they were gone. I knew better than to 
trust the silence. My ears twitched, straining for a sound that wasnʼt there. A 
growl, a scrape—anything to tell me where they were.
 Nothing.
 My claws flexed, indecision biting at me. “Itʼs fine,ˮ I muttered under my breath. 
“Weʼll make it back before—ˮ
 Theyʼre still hunting you, you know, Cadmea cut in, his tone casual but biting. Just 
because you canʼt hear them doesnʼt mean theyʼve stopped. Youʼre not as good 
at covering your tracks as you think.
 I gritted my teeth. “And you think hanging around here is safer?ˮ
 I think standing here is stupid. His words curled through my thoughts, heavy with 
sarcasm. But what do I know?
 Hardly a few steps in, I heard a rustling from the surrounding darkness. No way. 
They found me already? I wondered, cursing under my breath.
 Get out of here. This is my area, Cadmea snapped at me, earning a tired eye roll.
 I stood frozen in place, as if not moving meant theyʼd sniff me and leave me alone. 
My eyes scanned the darkness ahead for the slightest movement.
 The rustling came again, sharper this time, causing my ears to twitch.
 If youʼre waiting for an invitation to die, youʼre doing great, Cadmea said, his tone 
teetering between mockery and irritation. Move, Andrew!
“Fine,ˮ I said through clenched teeth, gripping the package tucked beneath my 
jacket tighter. My claws flexed against the glass bottle in my other hand. If they 
showed themselves, Iʼd have to fight—and with my hands full, it wouldnʼt end well.
 I couldnʼt fight like this.
 “You win,ˮ I hissed under my breath, letting the tension ease from my shoulders. 
My claws retracted as I slowed my breathing and focused. The surrounding air 
thickened, buzzing faintly with energy. The edges of the world blurred, the 
shadows of Riar dissolving into something colder, stranger.
 The Aether Silva rippled into view.
 The transition was seamless, like stepping into a thought. As the cobblestones 
beneath my feet vanished, ash replaced them, clinging to my paws like static 
snow. The air grew still, heavy, and unnervingly silent. Twisted, skeletal trees 
stretched toward the pale sky, their bark bleached of life. Wisps of pastel light
blues, greens, purples—danced in the distance like embers carried on an 
individual breeze.
 The aether curled through the air in streaks of vivid blue smoke. The rivers carved 
glowing paths through the ash-laden plains, their electric glow sharp against the 
muted world.
 Donʼt get comfortable, Cadmea warned, his voice sharper here, louder, as though 
the Silva amplified his presence. Youʼre wasting time, and time here is not your 
friend.
 “Right,ˮ I muttered, my voice sounding too small in the oppressive silence. My 
claws worked quickly, scraping at the ash beneath one of the twisted trees. The 
cold bit at my fingers, but I didnʼt stop until Iʼd hollowed out enough space for the 
bottle and package.
 I reached for the items, but my hand faltered. My claws twitched, suddenly no 
longer under my control.
 “Cadmea,ˮ I growled, trying to resist.
 Relax, he said, his tone as smooth as it was maddening. Youʼre terrible at this, 
anyway. Let me help.
 I gritted my teeth but didnʼt fight him. My claws moved with precision, Cadmeaʼs 
influence palpable as he placed the items into the hollow. He covered them with 
ash, his movements quick and deliberate, as though heʼd done this a thousand 
times before.
 The Silva seemed to shift around us, its ominous hum growing faintly louder.
 Done, Cadmea said, satisfaction oozing from his tone. Now, if youʼre finished 
playing delivery boy, letʼs get out of here before something bigger than you decide 
to take notice.
 I wrested control back, the transition jarring but familiar. My claws retracted as I 
stepped back, my breathing shallow. The Aether felt heavier now, pressing against 
my chest like a weight. I couldnʼt stay here much longer.
 The world blurred again, the Silva fading like smoke caught in the wind. The cold 
ash and haunting light gave way to the damp shadows of Riar, the sharp stench of 
stone and grime rushing back to meet me. My boots hit the cobblestones, and I 
staggered slightly, the lingering weight of the Silva clinging to my limbs.
 But I wasnʼt alone.
 A faint rustle came from the shadows, sharper and closer than before. My claws 
flexed instinctively as I scanned the alley.
 The glint of sapphire fur caught my eye, and my breath hitched. The blue fox 
stood motionless, its sleek coat shimmering faintly in the moonlight.
 It didnʼt belong here.
 Kill it, Cadmea said dryly.
 “Kill yourself,ˮ I muttered, bracing myself as the creatureʼs ears twitched toward 
me. The fox cocked its head, as if it understood, its bright, cautious eyes locking 
with mine.
 The tension snapped taut as it growled softly, its tail flicking low and deliberate.
 Better get moving, Cadmea said, his voice curling through my thoughts like a 
warning.
 The blue fox bolted into the darkness, leaving me staring after it. And then I heard 
it—the snarling, guttural sounds of wraithhounds closing in behind me.
 “Dammit,ˮ I said, already in motion, kicking myself for wasting so much time.
 The snarling sounds of wraithhounds were approaching quickly from behind.
The threat grew louder as they tore across the stone, giving way to the chase. I 
didnʼt dare look back. My lungs burned as I dashed towards the apartment, the 
shadows closing in like a suffocating shroud.
 This is just great, Cadmea chimed in, his tone mockingly harsh. You really think 
you can outrun them, Andrew? Fine. Try not to embarrass us both for once.
 “Thatʼs it!ˮ I yelled between ragged breaths, my paws skidding to a halt on the 
uneven cobblestones. In one fell swoop, I extended my claws from my fingertips 
and swung a fist backwards, catching a wraithhound mid lunge in the jaw. Its head 
snapped to the sided and the body following suit as it twisted into smoke.
 A second hound had followed up closely behind the first, snapping at the empty 
spot where I stood with its powerful jaws. I instantly appeared beside it, using my 
body weight to crush it to the ground with my elbow.
 Two more pounced at me from either side, but I phased a pace behind me, letting 
the fifth hound impale its neck on my claws.
 My yellow eyes burned with a red fiery rage. Each beat of my heart adding to the 
void reserved for my fury. As the wraithhound disintegrated, I spun around, just in 
time to kick one in the jaw, snapping its neck instantly.
 The final hound growled at me, its stance low, but I was beyond its existence at 
that point. I strutted towards it as it dove for me, easily ducking around the jump 
and catching its tail, slicing it off with my free hand. It whimpered, scrambling to 
its feet, but not quickly enough.
 “Why do you torment me—,ˮ I screamed in a rage, pummeling its face with a fist 
for every syllable, “Every. Chance. You. Get?ˮ It dusted, and I stood there in the 
middle of the road like a crazed maniac, huffing to catch my breath.
 Silence.
 The realization of what Iʼd just done slowly sank in with the euphoric feeling of 
isolation.
 I didnʼt care what anyone thought anymore. Iʼd been dealing with Cadmeaʼs sly 
remarks for three years. “Answer me!ˮ I demanded, the intensity in my voice 
scaring even myself.
 Silence.
“Do you want me to die?ˮ I roared, turning in different directions with each 
sentence. “Do you hate me that much? What did I ever do to you?ˮ
 Silence.
 I retracted my claws, spitting on the ground before I spun towards the apartment 
to make the rest of the trek home.
 Useless piece of shit, I thought. The phrase kept repeating itself in my head. 
Finally, Cadmea snapped back.
 Useless? Who do you think keeps you alive when you pull stunts like this? His 
voice dripped with venom. Without me, youʼd be dead.
 You think that gives you some sort of pass to make every waking moment of my 
life an absolute nightmare? I wasnʼt sure what my thoughts sounded like, but if 
yelling a thought was possible, I was doing it.
 If you didnʼt make yourself such an easy target, maybe you wouldnʼt always be 
the victim! He screeched, as if that meant anything to me. Face it! Youʼre 
hopeless, Andrew. Itʼs a surprise you made it to three, and we both know how 
much luck was involved.
 I bit my tongue, but it didnʼt stop my thoughts. Call me Andrew one more time. I 
dare you.
 I argued with Cadmea the entire rest of the way, never uttering a syllable. My face 
made all the correct facial expressions as we talked in my head, and in hindsight, I 
would have loved to see what that looked like.
 Finally, I made it to the apartment steps. I stomped my way up the stairs, leaning 
against the apartment door as I leveled my emotions. After a few deep breaths, I 
pushed the door open and stepped inside.
 The smell of Caelumʼs cooking drifted through the air, something savory and rich. 
The sound of muffled voices carried from the living room.
 “Fox?ˮ Caelumʼs voice called out, sharper than usual. His head appeared from 
around the corner, his red hair catching the light. “Where the hell have you been?ˮ
 “Out,ˮ I said, sliding my hands into the pockets of my torn jacket.
 Korbenʼs laughter echoed from the couch before I could take another step. “Thatʼs 
specific. Let me guess—heʼs been in one of his moods again.ˮ
“What did you do? We just got you that jacket!ˮ Caelum said, ready to lie into me.
 “Save it, Cael. Iʼm not in the mood.ˮ I said, growling through my teeth. My eyes still 
burned from the fire inside them as I stomped my way through the apartment, 
heading straight for the couch.
 Caelum was stubborn, but he picked up on the intensity in my voice and returned 
his attention to his task.
 Korben tossed a pillow at me as I sat, but I caught it without looking, puncturing it 
accidentally, spurting out a small burst of stuffing.
 “You look like crap,ˮ he said, leaning back with an affable grin that didnʼt quite 
reach his eyes. “Rough night?ˮ
 I dropped the pillow beside me and glanced toward Caelum. He was still watching 
me, stirring something in a large pot, and his gaze much sharper than I liked. 
“What?ˮ I said.
 Instead of snapping back at me, Caelʼs expression softened. His nose wrinkled 
slightly as he let out a sigh. Caelumʼs emotional maturity outrivaled everyone's, 
despite him being the youngest. It was as if he bypassed typical emotional 
triggers, always seeing a situation for what it truly was. “Are you hurt?ˮ
 Suddenly, the pain from my wounds radiated through my body. “I wasnʼt until you 
reminded me.ˮ I said, wincing as I leaned back.
 Korben raised an eyebrow, his grin fading into something more serious. 
“Wraithhound?ˮ
 I nodded, and the room fell silent except for the faint clatter of Caelumʼs utensils as 
he moved back to the kitchen. He said nothing, but I could feel the tension in his 
movements.
 “Youʼre supposed to tell us when youʼre doing this stuff,ˮ Korben said, his voice 
quieter now. “You canʼt just—ˮ
 “I didnʼt go looking for it,ˮ I said, cutting him off. “It just happened.ˮ
 “And you didnʼt think to phase back?ˮ Caelum asked from the kitchen.
 I shook my head. “I didnʼt want to provoke more of them to join the fray, but 
eventually I phased to kill them all.ˮ
Caelum didnʼt respond. Korben sighed and leaned back, rubbing a hand through 
his hair. “Youʼre going to give us all a damn heart attack one of these days.ˮ
 I didnʼt answer. The weight in my chest hadnʼt gone away. There was something 
out there… something hunting me. Fear clung to my nerve endings like an electric 
balloon. Cadmea was still quiet, likely seething over our fight earlier, like I still had 
been.
 The silence stretched longer than I liked. Korben busied himself flipping through a 
stack of magazines on the coffee table, the lighthearted smirk heʼd tried to wear 
now fully replaced by furrowed brows. Caelum, ever methodical, had turned his 
attention back to the sink, the sound of running water punctuating the otherwise 
still room. I felt their unspoken questions hanging between us.
 “You sure it was just the hound?ˮ Korben finally asked, his tone low.
 “Iʼm not sure of anything right now,ˮ I said, leaning back on the couch. The fabric 
felt coarse against the pads of my fingers as I clenched them. “But it wasnʼt 
normal.ˮ
 “That much is obvious,ˮ Caelum turned off the water with a deliberate motion, 
wiping his hands on a dishrag as he stepped into view. “But you donʼt just run into 
wraithhounds. Especially not here.ˮ
 “It wasnʼt just the wraithhound,ˮ My voice was quiet but steady. I glanced toward 
the window, the city lights beyond a dull backdrop. “Someoneʼs clearly targeting 
me. I mean, how else could a wraithhound even be in Orion?ˮ
 Korben shrugged. “Youʼve gotta be right. I donʼt see another explanation. Unless 
youʼre leaving the door open. Is that a thing?ˮ His grin returned but weaker, like 
armor that didnʼt quite fit.
 I shook my head. “I donʼt believe so. It didnʼt feel random,ˮ I said carefully. “The 
hounds… they werenʼt wandering. They had orders. Ignore everything else and 
focus on me. And then a blue fox—ˮ I stopped myself, unsure how to explain the 
inexplicable.
 Korben perked up at that, rolling his eyes. “Damn, Crit. Youʼre getting good. I 
actually believed you.ˮ
 The redhead smirked, feeling foolish. “Yeah. You had us going until you threw the 
in the blue fox.ˮ he said, his gaze moving towards the kitchen. “Good try though.ˮ
“No, Iʼm not lying. It was there. I got close. Then it growled and took off into the 
woods behind the Hydraʼs Den. It knew something was wrong.ˮ
 Caelum leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees. “Blue foxes are wild 
creatures. Rare, yes, but wild. Are you saying it helped you?ˮ
 “Iʼm not saying anything!ˮ My words came out sharper than intended. “It was 
there. It looked at me like… like it knew something. Then it bolted. Thatʼs it.ˮ
 “You didnʼt follow it?ˮ Korben asked, incredulous.
 “No,ˮ I said, my voice flat. “I didnʼt. Cadmea told me to run and then gave me shit 
for not following the fox.ˮ
 He whistled low, shaking his head. ““Why do you even bother with him? Heʼs a 
deadbeat vagrant, and he knows it.ˮ His cheerful disposition always faded at the 
mention of Cadmea. “That beauty couldʼve been worth a fortune. Not to mention, 
it mightʼve led you to whatever—ˮ
 “This wasnʼt about money!ˮ I cut him off. My claws flexed involuntarily, digging 
into the couch cushions before I forced them to retract. “It wasnʼt just an animal. It 
felt... it was almost like it knew me.ˮ
 Korben raised his hands in mock surrender, though his grin didnʼt fully fade. “Hey, 
Iʼm just saying. If some mysterious creature showed up in the middle of a 
wraithhound attack, Iʼd want to know why.ˮ
 “Me too! I want to know.ˮ The tension coiled tighter in my chest.
 Cadmeaʼs voice rang through my head. Let it go, Fox. They canʼt understand the 
feeling the same as you.
 I frowned, shooting him a warning glance… despite him not seeing it. There wasnʼt 
much to say to him.
 Caelumʼs voice broke the silence. “So, whatʼs your next move?ˮ
 I blinked at him, surprised by the question. “Next move?ˮ
 “Yes,ˮ he said firmly. “If someoneʼs hunting you, we canʼt just wait for them to 
strike againˮ
 For a moment, the weight of his words pressed against me. He wasnʼt wrong. The 
hounds, the stalker—someone with access to the Aether Silva. The blue fox—
none of it made sense, but I couldnʼt ignore the pattern forming. This was only the 
start.
 “I donʼt know,ˮ I admitted, my voice low. “I need to figure out who—or what—is 
behind this.ˮ
 Korben leaned back, his grin now fully gone. “Whatever it is, youʼre not doing it 
alone.ˮ
 I glanced at him, his usual carefree demeanor replaced by something harder, more 
resolute. Caelum nodded in agreement, his sharp eyes meeting mine.
 “Youʼre stuck with us, Crit,ˮ he continued, his tone lighter but no less serious. “You 
donʼt get a choice.ˮ
 I didnʼt answer right away. The weight in my chest finally lightened—just barely—
 at the thought of not carrying this alone. But even as they said it, I felt more alone 
than ever. Someone—or something—was hunting me. And it would only stop once 
it got what it wanted.
 A voice ran through my mind again. Fox… Go lay down and rest for a little while. Iʼll 
wake you up.
 “What do you care?ˮ I snapped, earning a quizzical eyebrow from the older 
brother.
 Caelum recognized it immediately. “Cadmea,ˮ he said, returning to the kitchen to 
finish dinner. Korben nodded in understanding, his attention refocused on 
whatever he had been doing prior.
 Youʼre right. What do I care? I couldnʼt be nice to you if I wanted to. Youʼd never 
allow it.
 I opened my mouth to argue back, but nothing came out. He was right—at least in 
that instance, completely right. My vision was blurring from exhaustion as I stood, 
slogging my way to my room. Once inside, I closed the door and flopped onto my 
bed.
